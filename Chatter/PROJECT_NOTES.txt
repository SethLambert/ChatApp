Chatter Version 0.1 04/24/2018
Created by: Seth Lambert

This project implemenets a server application that runs a multithreaded socket connection. The server allows more than one client to connect at once. The server maintains user data and will not allow duplicate registrations. 

There is a text file that keeps track of the users status. It is default to NOT_ACTIVE but updates to ACTIVE when the user logs in. This is how we are able to populate the friends list. 

Once friends are logged in they can choose to connect. Once connected, there is a MessageQueue text file that is meant to store and display messages whenever the server is called. This is not instant, it works more like email.

When the client enters a LOGOUT command, they are prompted to enter a custom away message that would be displayed with the friends list. The away messages are store in the UserStatus file.

Chatter.py is a GUI that is meant to work with the client app, but it has not been implemented at this time.

Known issues:
-The MessageQueue has been problematic, since there is nothing protecting it from being opened by both clients.
-When the client is closed unexpectedly, the UserStatus text file is not updated to NOT_ACTIVE, and this breaks the program on next launch
-The friends list will get stuck in a loop when less than 2 people are logged in.
